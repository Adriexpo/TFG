# Card Grading AI

## The context: Why did I start this project?

I am sure you must have heard the saying "Do what you love, and you'll never work a day in your life.", I have heard it too and, when the time for choosing a thesis topic came I thought "Let's put this saying to the test". 

I have been a Yu-Gi-Oh! collector for quite some time now and most of my cards are bought online, through Cardmarket.com and, from time to time, I purchase cards that arrive in a condition notoriously different compared to its listing.

The goal of this AI project is not to perfectly grade cards or give a numerical rating, but rather to detect defects or imperfections in the card and provide the user with an estimated rating based on the groups Poor, Played, Light Played, Good, Excellent, Near Mint and Mint. 

This way, what the AI provides can confirm or cast doubt on the user's human evaluation of the card's status, causing them to question their first evaluation and perhaps correct it or, at the very least, generate doubt to the point of offering photos to potential buyers to make sure they agree on its condition.
